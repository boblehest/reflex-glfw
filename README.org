* reflex-glfw
*** Home

    The home of =reflex-glfw= is at it Github page: https://github.com/deepfire/reflex-glfw

*** Reflex 0.5

    /reflex-glfw/ depends on a pre-release version of =reflex=, which means having
    to jump through extra hoops to use /reflex-glfw/.

***** Installing via Nix
      By far the easiest and most reliable way to do this is to employ the /Nix/
      package manager, which, unless you already have it, has to be installed
      first, of course:

      - https://nixos.org/nix/

*** Building the demo

    Once you have /Nix/ installed, building the demo is as easy as:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE sh
    nix-shell --no-build-output
    cabal build
    dist/build/reflex-glfw-demo/reflex-glfw-demo
    #+END_QUOTE
